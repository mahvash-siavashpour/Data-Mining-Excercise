## Project Description
A series of different data mining sub-projects are implemented in this project. This project was implemented to practice using different libraries and to work with different algorithms to gain knowledge and experience in this field of science. The full explanation of each sub-projects is written in the following sections.
### Analysing Iris Dataset
